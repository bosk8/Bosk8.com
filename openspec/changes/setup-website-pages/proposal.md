## Why
The current website only has a single landing page with a 2x2 grid layout. To provide a complete user experience, we need to create individual pages for each section (AI-Powered, Cloud Solutions, Data Analytics, Portfolio) that follow the exact same dark theme and design patterns established in the current site.

## What Changes
- Create dedicated pages for each main section (AI-Powered, Cloud Solutions, Data Analytics, Portfolio)
- Implement consistent navigation between pages
- Maintain the exact dark theme, typography, and layout patterns from the current design
- Add responsive design that works on mobile devices
- Create a cohesive multi-page website structure

## Impact
- Affected specs: website (new capability)
- Affected code: New HTML pages, updated CSS for navigation, potential JavaScript for interactions
- **BREAKING**: Current single-page structure will be replaced with multi-page navigation
